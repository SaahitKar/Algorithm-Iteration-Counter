# Algorithm-Iteration-Counter

This program counts the number of iterations for the sort and the number of movements with the array for each sorting algorithm. This program also calculates the time elapsed for each sorting algorithm to be complete. The six sorting algorithms are: insertion sort, radix sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort, and heap sort. There are four types of arrays to be sorted by each of the sorting algorithms: a sorted array, a reverse-sorted array, a randomly sorted array, and a fractionally random array.
